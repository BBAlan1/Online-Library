**Project Proposal: Online Library Web Application**


**Project Relevance (Why This Topic Was Chosen)**

The proposal for an online library addresses a growing demand for accessible, versatile
platforms that facilitate seamless book discovery, purchase, and reading experiences. With the
shift towards digitalization in Kazakhstan, particularly as more people engage with online
services for convenience, an online library serves as a solution for users who may face
accessibility issues with traditional libraries. By providing users with 24/7 access to resources, an
online library can effectively bridge gaps in access to both educational and leisure reading
material. Moreover, promoting reading culture is crucial for educational and cultural
advancement, and this project’s digital approach aligns well with these goals.


**Competitor Analysis: Online Libraries in Kazakhstan**

Kazakhstan’s current online book market includes platforms like Litres, Marwin and Meloman.kz, which are quite well-known. 
However, these mainly focus on popular fiction and do not offer a lot of academic or cultural books.
Our online library will be different because users will be able to list and sell their own books, making it similar to an OLX-style marketplace for books. 
We will also use a flexible pricing model, including student discounts and academic partnerships, making our library more affordable. T
hese unique features are designed to attract niche readers and students who need specialized content that is hard to find elsewhere.

**Target Audience (Project Auditory)**

The online library’s target audience encompasses a range of user groups who seek diverse
reading material:
This group includes high school and university students in need of academic resources,
textbooks, and research materials that are often difficult or expensive to source physically.
Individuals pursuing professional growth in areas such as business, technology, science, and
other specialized fields can benefit from tailored content for professional development.
Casual readers with an interest in fiction, non-fiction, and local authors will find a rich selection
of books that are less accessible in physical bookstores.
Schools, universities, and libraries can partner with our platform to offer digital resources,
expanding students' access to quality reading materials.
By catering to these distinct user groups, the platform seeks to position itself as a comprehensive
resource, accessible from any location, meeting various reading and research needs within
Kazakhstan.


**Project Features (Functionality and Design Ideas)**  
Our platform will have the following key features:  
- A clean and modern design for easy navigation through books and categories.  
- Advanced filters and search options to help users quickly find books by genre, author, language, or publication date.  
- A recommendation system that uses machine learning to suggest books based on user preferences and reading history.  
- Book previews, allowing users to read excerpts before deciding to buy, which is especially useful for academic books.  
- Reliable protection of user data.  
- Payment options available only through credit cards.  
- Community features, such as book ratings and user feedback, to help others make informed choices.  

**Conclusion**  

This online library project will meet the diverse reading needs of people in Kazakhstan, filling specific gaps in the availability of specialized and localized content. 
By allowing users to sell their own books and offering flexible pricing options, we aim to stand out in the market. 
Our affordable, easy-to-use platform will be a valuable resource for students, professionals, and casual readers, encouraging a culture of reading and supporting education. 
With a focus on practical features and a user-friendly design for PC, we are committed to building a reliable, engaging online library that keeps up with the digital world.
